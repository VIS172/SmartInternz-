Titanic Classification Project


The classifier is designed to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic based on their attributes.


Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature engineering and selection
Implementation of multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks)
Evaluation of classifier performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
Model serialization using pickle
Ensemble learning with Voting Classifier
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (can be installed via requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd titanic-classification
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:
Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and place the files in the data/ directory.

Code Overview
1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing ones (e.g., family size, title extraction from names).
Pickle Serialization: Saving the preprocessed data for future use.
2. Classifiers
Logistic Regression (LR)
Decision Trees (DT)
Random Forest (RF)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (NN)
Voting Classifier: An ensemble model combining LR, DT, and RF.
3. Model Training and Evaluation
Training: Fitting the models to the training data.
Evaluation: Calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for the models.
Pickle Serialization: Saving the trained models to files.
Usage
Train and Evaluate Models
The titanic_classifier.py script includes code for training multiple classifiers and evaluating their performance. The results are printed out with various evaluation metrics.

Serialize Models
Models and vectorizers are serialized using pickle for later use:

python
Copy code
import pickle

# Save the model
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(model, file)

# Load the model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
Run the Script
To run the analysis and build the model, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python titanic_classifier.py
